# Rod-Cutter

Created for USM Computer Science CSC 413 - Algorithms.

This program was created for use of academic purposes. Feel free to use as desired but please give credit.

This is a simple c++ program to find the maximum value from cutting a rod of length designated by the user. 

The program uses a recursive call to find the most value in the cutting the length of a rod into smaller pieces. 
The maximum value then gets displayed to the user and the user is given the option to check another value. 

The program can easily be modified to accept longer rod lengths with a simple edit to the while loop and increasing the pricing list array. Unfortunately the values given to me at this time were only up to 10. This is why the program only accepts a rod of size 0 to 10.
